# n_bit_multiplier
 This module is a recursive implementation of the n-bit unsigned binary multiplier. The number of bits (n) of the multipliers can be managed by the BIT_DEPTH parameter. So, the module is reconfigurable according to the bit depth of multipliers before synthesis. Therefore, the utilization of the sources changes with the parameter BIT_DEPTH. 
 
 The module is called recursively inside the generate block. The first call starts with BIT_DEPTH configured in the parameters then it calls itself BIT_DEPTH/2 bit depth each time until BIT_DEPTH=2. Therefore, it all starts with 2-bit x 2-bit multiplication by using half adders. For example in an 8-bit multiplier, initially 4-bit multiplier is generated by 2-bit x 2-bit multipliers, and then an 8-bit multiplier is generated by using 4-bitx4-bit multipliers.

 In the n_bit_multiplier/src/n_bit_mul.v, it can be seen that bit depth is defined as 32. Above you can see the utilization of the sources for the part xc7z020clg484-1.

There is a multiplication simulation of the 32-bit configuration of the module. In the simulation, (2-4-8-16-32)-bit binary number multiplications are tested for two examples each bit depth.

# 16_bit_multiplier

Non-recursive version of n_bit_multiplier is added for comparison of utilization and functionality.

It can be seen from the utilization result above, they have used the same amount of sources.

Also, the module retains its functionality when comparing the recursive one.
