# n_bit_multiplier
 This module is a recursive implementation of the n-bit unsigned binary multiplier. The number of bits (n) of the multipliers can be managed by the BIT_DEPTH parameter. So, the module is reconfigurable according to the bit depth of multipliers before synthesis. Therefore, the utilization of the sources changes with the parameter BIT_DEPTH. 
 
 The module is called recursively inside the generate block. The first call starts with BIT_DEPTH configured in the parameters then it calls itself BIT_DEPTH/2 bit depth each time until BIT_DEPTH=2. Therefore, it all starts with 2-bit x 2-bit multiplication by using half adders. For example in an 8-bit multiplier, initially 4-bit multiplier is generated by 2-bitx2-bit multipliers, and then an 8-bit multiplier is generated by using 4-bitx4-bit multipliers.

 In the n_bit_multiplier/src/n_bit_mul.v, it can be seen that bit depth is defined as 32. Above you can see the utilization of the sources for the part xc7z020clg484-1.

There is a multiplication simulation of the 32-bit configuration of the module. In the simulation, (2-4-8-16-32)-bit binary number multiplications are tested for two examples each bit depth.
